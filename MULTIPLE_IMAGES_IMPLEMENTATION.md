# Multiple Images Support Implementation

## Overview
Updated the destination and hotel admin modals to support multiple images instead of just a single image URL input, making it much more practical for managing real-world content.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multiple Images Management
- **Before**: Single "Image URL" text input field
- **After**: Dynamic image array management with:
  - Add multiple image URLs one by one
  - Visual preview of each image (thumbnail)
  - Remove individual images
  - Set any image as the featured image with one click

### 2. Enhanced Facilities/Amenities Management
- **Destinations**: Facilities management with tags (e.g., Parking, WiFi, Restaurant)
- **Hotels**: Amenities management with tags (e.g., Pool, Gym, Spa)
- Visual tag-based interface for easy addition/removal

### 3. Better User Experience
- Visual image previews with thumbnails
- Easy "Set as Featured" button for each image
- Tag-based input for facilities/amenities
- Clean, intuitive interface for managing multiple items

## Updated Components

### DestinationModal Features:
```typescript
// Form data now includes:
{
  images: string[],           // Array of image URLs
  featured_image: string,     // Single featured image
  facilities: string[],       // Array of facility names
  // ... other fields
}
```

### HotelModal Features:
```typescript
// Form data now includes:
{
  images: string[],           // Array of image URLs  
  featured_image: string,     // Single featured image
  amenities: string[],        // Array of amenity names
  // ... other fields
}
```

## UI Components Added

### Image Management Section:
- Input field + "Add" button for new image URLs
- Image grid with thumbnails, URLs, and action buttons
- "Remove" button for each image
- "Set as Featured" button for non-featured images
- Separate featured image input field

### Facilities/Amenities Management:
- Input field + "Add" button for new items
- Tag-based display of current items
- "×" button on each tag for removal
- Color-coded tags (blue for facilities, green for amenities)

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Content Management**: Hotels and destinations typically have multiple photos
2. **Better User Experience**: Visual previews and easy management
3. **Flexibility**: Can add/remove images and facilities dynamically
4. **Featured Image Control**: Easy selection of main image from the collection
5. **Clean Interface**: Modern tag-based UI for managing arrays of data

## Database Compatibility
- Fully compatible with existing `images: string[]` database schema
- Works with existing `featured_image: string` field
- No database changes required - only UI improvements

## Usage
1. **Adding Images**: Enter image URL and click "Add"
2. **Managing Images**: View thumbnails, remove unwanted images
3. **Setting Featured**: Click "Set as Featured" on any image
4. **Adding Facilities/Amenities**: Enter name and click "Add"
5. **Removing Items**: Click "×" on any tag to remove

This implementation provides a much more practical and user-friendly way to manage multiple images and related data for destinations and hotels in the admin dashboard.
