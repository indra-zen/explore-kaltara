# React State Update Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: "Can't perform a React state update on a component that hasn't mounted yet. This indicates that you have a side-effect in your render function that asynchronously later calls tries to update the component. Move this work to useEffect instead."

## Root Cause
The error was caused by calling `setIsFiltering(true)` inside the `useMemo` hook, which executes during the render phase. React doesn't allow state updates during rendering as it can cause infinite re-render loops and other issues.

## Files Fixed
1. `/src/app/hotels/page.tsx`
2. `/src/app/destinations/page.tsx`

## Solution Applied

### Before (Problematic Code):
```tsx
const filteredHotels = useMemo(() => {
  setIsFiltering(true); // ❌ State update during render
  
  const filtered = hotels.filter(/* filtering logic */);
  
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setIsFiltering(false); // ❌ More state updates during render
  }, 300);
  
  return filtered;
}, [dependencies]);
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```tsx
// Pure computation without side effects
const filteredHotels = useMemo(() => {
  const filtered = hotels.filter(/* filtering logic */);
  return filtered;
}, [dependencies]);

// Side effects moved to useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  setIsFiltering(true);
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setIsFiltering(false);
  }, 300);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [searchQuery, selectedLocation, selectedCategory, minRating]);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Removed state updates from useMemo**: The `useMemo` hook now only contains pure computation without side effects
2. **Added separate useEffect for filtering state**: A dedicated `useEffect` hook handles the `isFiltering` state updates
3. **Proper cleanup**: Added cleanup function to clear timers when dependencies change
4. **Removed redundant loading effects**: Cleaned up unnecessary duplicate loading state management

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates React warnings**: No more state update during render errors
- ✅ **Better performance**: Pure `useMemo` calculations are more efficient
- ✅ **Cleaner separation of concerns**: Computation vs side effects are properly separated
- ✅ **Proper cleanup**: Timers are properly cleared to prevent memory leaks

## Testing
- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ Hotels page loads and filters work correctly  
- ✅ Destinations page loads and filters work correctly
- ✅ No React warnings in console

The fix ensures React best practices are followed and eliminates the state update warnings while maintaining the same user experience with filtering animations.
