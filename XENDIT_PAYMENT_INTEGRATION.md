5. User completes payment
6. Xendit sends webhook notification
7. System updates booking status to "confirmed"
8. User is redirected to success page

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Added to bookings table:
payment_id TEXT           -- Xendit invoice ID
payment_status TEXT       -- pending, completed, failed, expired, refunded
paid_at TIMESTAMPTZ      -- Payment completion timestamp
```

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/payment/create` - Create payment invoice
- `POST /api/payment/webhook` - Handle payment notifications
