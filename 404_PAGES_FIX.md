# 404 Error Fix for Admin and Profile Pages

## Problem
The admin and profile pages were showing 404 errors when accessed in the browser.

## Root Cause
The Next.js cache (`.next` directory) became corrupted with multiple ENOENT (file not found) errors for build manifest files:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\...\app-build-manifest.json'
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\...\buildManifest.js.tmp.*'
```

This corruption prevented Next.js from properly serving the pages, causing them to return 404 errors despite the page files existing correctly.

## Solution
1. **Stop the development server**
2. **Clear the Next.js cache**:
   ```bash
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```
3. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## Result
- ✅ `/profile` page now loads correctly (compiled in 9s, returns 200 OK)
- ✅ `/admin` page now loads correctly (compiled in 1.5s, returns 200 OK)
- ✅ No more file system errors in terminal output
- ✅ Clean development server startup

## Prevention
This type of cache corruption can be prevented by:
- Properly stopping the development server (Ctrl+C) instead of killing the process
- Avoiding frequent process interruptions during development
- Regularly clearing the cache when encountering unusual behavior

## Files Affected
- No code files were modified
- Only the Next.js cache directory was cleared and regenerated

## Note
This is a common Next.js development issue and the solution (clearing the cache) is a standard troubleshooting step for Next.js applications.
