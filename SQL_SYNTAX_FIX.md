# SQL Syntax Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
**Line 121**: Missing closing parenthesis in `NOW` function

### Before (incorrect):
```sql
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW') NOT NULL,
```

### After (fixed):
```sql
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL,
```

## Verification
- ✅ All `NOW()` functions have proper parentheses
- ✅ All SQL statements end with semicolons
- ✅ All parentheses are properly balanced
- ✅ All string literals are properly quoted
- ✅ All table and column names are valid

## Ready to Execute
The `supabase/complete_schema_fix.sql` file is now syntactically correct and ready to be executed in Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor.

## Next Steps
1. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/complete_schema_fix.sql`
2. Paste into Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
3. Click "RUN" to execute
4. Check for any execution errors (should run successfully now)
