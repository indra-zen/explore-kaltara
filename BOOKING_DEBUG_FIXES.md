# 🔧 Booking System Debug & Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Data Structure Mismatch**
**Problem:** `booking.details is undefined` error occurred because:
- `BookingContent.tsx` was saving with `bookingDetails` field
- `BookingManager.tsx` was expecting `details` field

**Solution:**
- Fixed `BookingContent.tsx` to save with correct field names:
  ```typescript
  const booking = {
    // ❌ Before: bookingDetails, paymentDetails, totalAmount
    // ✅ After: details, payment, total
    details: bookingForm,
    payment: { ...paymentForm },
    total: calculateTotal()
  };
  ```

### 2. **Data Migration & Safety**
**Added automatic migration for existing bookings:**
```typescript
// Migrate old booking structure to new structure
bookings = bookings.map((booking: any) => {
  if (booking.bookingDetails && !booking.details) {
    return {
      ...booking,
      details: booking.bookingDetails,
      payment: booking.paymentDetails || {},
      total: booking.totalAmount || booking.total || 0
    };
  }
  return booking;
});
```

### 3. **Null Safety Checks**
**Added comprehensive safety checks:**
- `booking.details?.checkIn` instead of `booking.details.checkIn`
- `booking.payment?.cardNumber?.slice(-4)` for safe access
- Validation before downloading receipts
- Error handling in `calculateNights` function

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
**Improved robustness:**
- Try-catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages
- Data validation before rendering

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Create New Booking:**
   - Go to any hotel page
   - Click "Pesan Sekarang"
   - Complete booking flow
   - Verify booking appears in profile

2. **Test Booking Manager:**
   - Go to Profile > Booking tab
   - Verify all bookings display correctly
   - Test download receipt functionality
   - Test cancel booking

3. **Test Migration:**
   - If you have old bookings, they should automatically migrate
   - All fields should display properly

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Bookings with missing dates
- Bookings with incomplete payment info
- Empty booking list
- Network interruptions during booking
