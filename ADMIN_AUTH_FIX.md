# Admin Authentication Redirect Fix

## Problem
When refreshing any admin page (admin dashboard, destinations, hotels, users), the user was being redirected to the homepage even when properly authenticated.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the authentication logic timing. During page refresh:
1. Supabase authentication state takes time to restore from session
2. During this restoration period, `isAuthenticated` is `false` and `user` is `null`
3. The `useEffect` immediately redirected users to homepage before authentication could complete
4. This happened because the logic didn't wait for the authentication loading state to complete

## Solution Applied

### 1. AuthContext Improvements
- Added proper loading state management
- Improved initial session handling to be more robust
- Added cleanup and mount checks to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Admin Pages Pattern Update
Applied this pattern to all admin pages (dashboard, destinations, hotels, users):

**Before:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (isLoading) return;
  if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
    router.push('/');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}, [user, isAuthenticated, isLoading]);
```

**After:**
```tsx
const [authChecked, setAuthChecked] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isLoading) {
    setAuthChecked(false);
    return;
  }
  
  setAuthChecked(true);
  
  if (!isAuthenticated || !user) {
    router.push('/');
    return;
  }
  
  if (!isAdminUser(user.email)) {
    router.push('/');
    return;
  }
  
  // Load page data only after auth is confirmed
  loadData();
}, [isLoading, isAuthenticated, user]);

// Loading condition updated
if (isLoading || !authChecked) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

### 3. Key Changes
1. **Added `authChecked` state**: Prevents rendering before authentication state is determined
2. **Improved loading conditions**: Shows loading until both auth loading is complete AND auth has been checked
3. **Removed `router` from dependencies**: Prevents unnecessary re-runs of the effect
4. **Better loading messages**: Distinguishes between "checking authentication" and "loading data"

### 4. Benefits
- ✅ No more unwanted redirects on page refresh
- ✅ Proper authentication state management
- ✅ Better user experience with appropriate loading states
- ✅ Consistent pattern across all admin pages
- ✅ More robust error handling

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved auth state management
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Fixed dashboard authentication
- `src/app/admin/destinations/page.tsx` - Fixed destinations page auth
- `src/app/admin/hotels/page.tsx` - Fixed hotels page auth  
- `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Fixed users page auth

## Test Results
The admin test page (`/admin/test`) can be used to verify the fix:
1. Navigate to any admin page while authenticated
2. Refresh the page
3. Should stay on the same page without redirect to homepage
4. Should show proper loading states during authentication check

## Next Steps
- Apply the same pattern to remaining admin pages (bookings, reviews, analytics, settings)
- Consider centralizing admin authentication logic into a custom hook
- Add comprehensive error handling for authentication failures
