# Admin Form Save Timeout Fixes

## Problem
When updating multiple fields (especially with 4-5 images) in the admin panel, the form would get stuck on "Saving..." and the data wouldn't save to the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `triggerRevalidation` method in `AdminService` which would:
1. Make a fetch request to `/api/revalidate` without proper timeout handling
2. Block the entire save operation if revalidation failed or timed out
3. Not handle errors gracefully, causing the admin UI to hang

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Timeout and Error Handling to Revalidation
**File**: `/src/lib/supabase/admin-service.ts`

- Added 5-second timeout to revalidation fetch requests
- Added AbortController to cancel hung requests
- Made revalidation non-blocking (failures don't stop the main operation)
- Added proper error logging without throwing errors

### 2. Improved Hotel Update Method
**File**: `/src/lib/supabase/admin-service.ts` - `updateHotel()`

- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Made activity logging non-blocking (catches errors)
- Made revalidation asynchronous and non-blocking
- Added better error messages for Supabase operations

### 3. Improved Destination Update Method  
**File**: `/src/lib/supabase/admin-service.ts` - `updateDestination()`

- Applied same improvements as hotel update method
- Better error handling and logging
- Non-blocking activity logging and revalidation

### 4. Enhanced Form Submission Flow
The admin forms now:
- Continue with save operation even if revalidation fails
- Show better error messages when actual database operations fail
- Don't get stuck waiting for external API calls

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic Code):
```typescript
// This would block and timeout
await this.triggerRevalidation('hotel', data.slug);
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```typescript
// This is non-blocking and has timeout protection
this.triggerRevalidation('hotel', data.slug).catch(revalError => {
  console.warn('Revalidation failed:', revalError);
});
```

### Timeout Implementation:
```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

await fetch('/api/revalidate', {
  // ... other options
  signal: controller.signal
});
```

## Benefits
1. **No More Hanging**: Forms won't get stuck on "Saving..." indefinitely
2. **Better User Experience**: Operations complete successfully even if revalidation fails
3. **Improved Debugging**: Better error logging to identify issues
4. **Resilient Operations**: Core functionality (save to database) is separated from optimization features (revalidation)
5. **Multiple Field Updates**: Can now safely update multiple fields including multiple images

## Testing
- Build successfully completes without errors
- Admin forms should now save properly even with multiple images
- Revalidation still works when network conditions are good
- System gracefully handles revalidation failures

## Notes
- Revalidation is still performed but doesn't block the user experience
- All database operations maintain their integrity
- Error messages are more informative for debugging
- The fixes are backwards compatible with existing functionality
